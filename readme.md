# MOTHER 3 to MIDI (WIP)

Converts MOTHER 3 MIDI rips into files conforming to the General MIDI Level 2 standard

You need Python.

## Usage
0. Make sure you have installed Python and the [Mido](https://pypi.org/project/mido/) module
1. ~~Obtain the [MOTHER 3 Ultimate Music Rip](https://forum.starmen.net/forum/Games/Mother3/MOTHER-3-Ultimate-Music-Rip) (down as of 9/29/25)~~
2. ~~Unpack it and move the `OSV` folder next to `fixosv.py`~~
3. Execute the script and watch the debug waterfall
4. Enjoy the music!

This script was originally created to target Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth, due to the game soundbank's shared usage of the Roland SC-88.

Most instruments have already been replaced, but some don't have the best fit, and some chords are missing.
